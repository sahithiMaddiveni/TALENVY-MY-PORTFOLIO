##Task Description

My personal portfolio website is a clean, user-friendly, and responsive project built using only HTML and CSS. It is designed to showcase who I am as an aspiring web developer, what skills I bring to the table, and the work I’ve done so far. This project serves both as a learning experience and a professional introduction to potential clients, employers, or collaborators.

The website starts with a fixed navigation bar at the top, allowing users to easily jump to different sections of the site such as About, Skills, Projects, Certifications, Resume, and Contact. I’ve also added icons to the navigation links using Font Awesome, giving the menu a polished and modern look. The layout is centered and fully responsive, ensuring a great experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

At the top of the site, the header section welcomes visitors with my name and a short tagline that summarizes what I do—such as “Frontend Developer | MERN Stack Enthusiast.” The background features a colorful gradient to make the first impression visually appealing.

Next is the About section, which includes a circular profile picture and a short bio. Here, I talk about my passion for web development, my learning journey so far, and what motivates me to build new things. It’s meant to be a friendly introduction for people who are just getting to know me.

The Skills section is presented as an ordered list, which keeps everything neatly aligned. Each skill is accompanied by an icon—for example, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. This section helps visitors quickly understand the technical tools and languages I am familiar with.

The Projects section showcases samples of my work. Each project is displayed in its own card, including an image, project name, and a short description. For example, I’ve included a portfolio website and a to-do list app. This section gives potential employers or collaborators a quick view of what I’ve built and what kind of projects I enjoy working on.

The new Certifications & Achievements section lists some of the courses I’ve completed and any competitions I’ve participated in. Items like “Responsive Web Design by NxtWave” are displayed in a friendly and professional format to highlight ongoing learning and growth.

In the Resume section, users can download my resume directly by clicking a colorful call-to-action button. This section is useful for recruiters or hiring managers who want quick access to my formal qualifications.

The Contact section includes all the ways someone can reach out to me. My email address and phone number are listed clearly. I’ve also added links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, each with their respective icons. This makes it easy for anyone to learn more about my background, view my code, or get in touch.

Finally, the site wraps up with a footer that includes a copyright notice.

In summary, this portfolio website is more than just a design project—it’s a snapshot of my growth and potential as a developer. It reflects my personality, skills, and enthusiasm for web development. Building it from scratch using only HTML and CSS taught me how to structure web pages properly, style them effectively, and create a cohesive layout without relying on JavaScript frameworks or libraries. I plan to keep updating the portfolio as I learn more, build new projects, and gain experience in the field.
